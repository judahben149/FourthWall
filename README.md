## Overview

FourthWall is an Android wallet application built with Kotlin. It leverages the power of decentralized technologies to offer a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for managing digital assets and identities.

## Key Features

- Secure wallet creation and management
- Decentralized identity (DID) integration
- Multi-currency support
- Best-rate currency exchange
- User-driven PFI ratings
- Transparent fee structure

## Design Considerations

### Profitability

FourthWall implements a transparent fee structure to ensure profitability while maintaining user trust:

- 1.5% fee on currency exchanges
- Clear communication of fees before each transaction

### Optionality

Our app empowers users with choice and information:

- Built-in algorithm compares offerings from all available PFIs
- Displays exchange rates, transaction fees, and user ratings for each PFI
- Highlights providers with the best track record when rates are similar

### Customer Management

FourthWall prioritizes user privacy and control:

- Secure generation and storage of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
- User-controlled sharing of DIDs with PFIs during transactions
- Option to unlink or revoke credentials at any time via profile settings

### Customer Satisfaction

We ensure high-quality service through:

- Post-transaction user ratings for PFIs
- Real-time aggregation and display of PFI scores
- Flagging and potential removal of consistently low-rated PFIs over time
